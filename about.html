      <h3>About The Badge</h3>
      <p>For this year's badge we chose an old school design. A couple years later the component shortage is still real
        y'all.</p>
      <h3>Manufacturing</h3>
      <p>The badge was designed and prototyped by Kevin Neubauer (<a
          href="https://infosec.exchange/@bl4cksmith">@bl4cksmith@infosec.exchange</a>) and Tyler Rosonke (<a
          href="https://twitter.com/zonksec">@zonksec</a>). Assembly was done by <a href="https://cybercitycircuits.com/">Cyber City
        Circuits</a> in Augusta, GA.</p>
      <h3>Interesting Bits</h3>
      <p>
        1.5V design (sadly this means most LEDs won't work)<br />
        Based on the TA7642 AM Radio IC<br />
        Hackable design (see the Activities page)<br />
        Has a small transistor amp, which makes it suitable for listening on headphones<br />
        Mono audio sent to both headphone channels<br />
        <!--
        Did you know that Spotify has 489 million monthly active listeners?
        I'm pretty sure our Kernelcon AM transmitters would burst into flames if we tried to broadcast to that many listeners.
      -->
      </p>
      <h3>RF Gain Knob</h3>
      <p>Worth it's own special mention is the RF Gain knob on the badge. This little beauty dials up or dials down the
        amount of power the RF tuning circuit receives. Why, you ask? This year's badge is an amazingly cheap, quick &
        dirty, unshielded, and non-earth grounded AM radio with a single inductor capacitor tuner.</p>
      <p>The TA7642 chip the
        badge is built around is supposed to have Automatic Gain Control (AGC). Think of AGC as adjusting the RF gain
        down when you are dialed into a strong station and adjusting it up when you are dialed into a weak station.
        There's one problem though. The TA7642 doesn't actually do this very well. It actually kind of sucks at doing
        it, but what can you expect for a 10 cent radio chip ordered direct from China off Aliexpress? </p>
      <p>The RF Gain knob is a hack to overcome the crappy TA7642 AGC. By turning down the power to the RF tuner you
        can, in some cases, achieve better selectivity across the tuner dial. Without this hack, you simply receive 1110
        KFAB across the whole tuner dial while you are in Omaha. Insert joke here about a radio
        station that plays Fox News trying to broadcast with enough power to take over the whole tuner dial.
      </p>
      <h3>Hacker Playground</h3>
      <p>
        We wanted to provide a place to have some hardware fun on the badge. Behold! The Hacker Playground.
      </p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="hacker_playground.jpg" /></p>
      <p>Here's what those cryptic letters mean:</p>
      <p>
      <table style="margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
        <tr>
          <td>VCC / 1.5V</td>
          <td style="text-align:left;">These pins carry 1.5 volts</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>GND</td>
          <td style="text-align:left;">These are ground pins</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>O</td>
          <td style="text-align:left;">Audio output from the radio IC <b>pre-amplifier</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>S</td>
          <td style="text-align:left;">Audio output from the radio IC <b>post-amplifier</b> and connects to the S pins
            on the headphone jack (unless you cut J-S).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>TR</td>
          <td style="text-align:left;">1.5V and connects to the TR pins on the headphone jack (unless you cut J-TR)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>J-S (not pictured)</td>
          <td style="text-align:left;">Solder jumper that severs the S pin of the headphone jack from the circuit when
            cut</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>J-TR (not pictured)</td>
          <td style="text-align:left;">Solder jumper that severs the TR pins of the headphone jack from the circuit when
            cut</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      <p>All unlabeled pins are yours to use. The are not connected to each other unless you connect them with wire or
        solder.</p>
      <h3>Schematic</h3>
      <p>Yes. It's a bit hard to read on this page. <a href="badge_schematic.png" target="_blank">Open it in a new
          tab</a> or <a href="badge_schematic.pdf" target="_blank">get a PDF</a>.</p>

      <h3>Super Secret Stuff</h3>
      <p>You've read this far, probably hoping to find some clues on "what's hidden in the badge" or something similar.
        I'm going to let you in on a secret...</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Nothing. There's absolutely nothing hidden <i>inside</i> the badge. There's no microcontroller. No flash
        storage.
        It's an old school analog design.</p>
      <p>If you aren't happy with this response, I don't blame you. Badge challenges are fun. Did I mention that we've
        still got badge challenges? Drop by the Kernelcon CTF to find out more.</p>
