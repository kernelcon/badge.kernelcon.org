      <h1>Amp & Volume Control</h1>
      <p>Add in a transistor amp to make your badge louder and a volume control knob.</p>
      <h3>Step 1</h3>
      <p>Get yourself the following components:</p>
      <p>
      <table style="margin-right:auto;margin-left:auto;">
        <tr>
          <td><b>Quantity</b></td>
          <td><b>Type</b></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>50K Potentiometer</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>8.2K Resistor</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>10nF Capacitor</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>2N3904 Transistor</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </p>
      <h3>Step 2</h3>
      <p>Look at the schematic.</p>
      <p><a href="activity_level3_img/level3_schematic.png" target="_blank">Make it larger in a new
          tab</a></p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_schematic.png" /></p>
      <h3>Step 3</h3>
      <p>Unplug your antenna and headphones. Pull your battery out.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step3.jpg" /></p>
      <h3>Step 4</h3>
      <p>Plan your component layout, especially the potentiometer. You can totally do this if you want:</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step4a.jpg" /></p>
      <p>But it looks a bit like an udder hanging off your badge. Maybe instead you'd like to drill and do a panel
        mount:</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step4b.jpg" /></p>
      <p>Much cooler, and you get to use a power tool in the process.</p>
      <p>The next thing you're going to do is to break any litle metal tabs off the front of the potentiometer. These
        tabs are meant for panel mounting, but in our design we don't have a place for them. This is a hack. Grab a pair
        of needle nose pliers and break them off. If you don't, the potentiometer will not sit flush on the PCB.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step4c.jpg" /></p>
      <p>Figure out where you can put the thing. You want to leave some space for the other components. You also want to
        avoid contact with other components or covering up the solder pads you'll be working with.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step4d.jpg" /></p>
      <p>Flip the potentiometer over and mark around the shaft. The marked circle will be where you drill.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step4e.jpg" /></p>
      <p>Finally, drill the hole that the potentiometer will go through. You will need a drill bit that is a slightly
        larger diameter than the shaft of the potentiometer. If you find that the larger drill bit wants to walk around
        the board instead of drilling, start with a smaller bit then make the hole larger with the desired drill bit
        size.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step4f.jpg" /></p>
      <h3>Step 5</h3>
      <p>Get an X-acto knife and cut through the middle of the J-TR solder jumper. There's a small trace connecting the
        two pads. It's a bit difficult to cut and you may need to apply some pressure while cutting. Be mindful of your
        fingers.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step5a.jpg" /></p>
      <p>Rotate the board so the J-S jumper is facing you. Before you cut the J-S jumper look at the below picture. See
        the red line? There is a battery power trace there. If you cut that, your badge will die and we will have to use
        a wire to bring it back to life. Repeat after me: "I will not cut the battery power trace." OK good. Now go cut
        the J-S solder jumper.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step5b.jpg" /></p>
      <p>Grab a multimeter and set it for continuity (Ohms)... The little greek Omega symbol. Put a probe on each side
        of the J-S solder pad. The meter should read like an open connection. It should NOT read 0 Ohms. If it does, go
        back to cutting. Repeat for the J-TR solder pad. If you need help, ask for help. It's important to make sure the
        headphone jack is completely disconnected.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step5c.jpg" /></p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step5d.jpg" /></p>
      <h3>Step 6</h3>
      <p>Put your potentiometer through the board and fasten the front side with a washer and retaining nut.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step6a.jpg" /></p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step6b.jpg" /></p>
      <h3>Step 7</h3>
      <p>This is where things start to get a little dicey. You're going to need to keep track of transistor orientation
        and which transistor pins you're connecting to what other components.</p>
      <p>If you place the 2N3904 transistor on the table so the flat part is facing up like in the diagram below, pin 1
        is on the left side and pin 3 on the right.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/2n3904-pinout.jpg" /></p>
      <p><b>NOTE:</b> When you start soldering do not immediately clip off excess component leads. Those leads will help
        you connect components together. It is much easier to bend the lead to the next hole you want to connect to than
        to blob a solder bridge between two holes.</p>
      <p>We are going to be connecting pin 3 of the 2N3904 to VCC. Go ahead and solder it in. Also solder in the 10nF
        capacitor so that it's in a hole right next to pin 1 of the 2N3904. Stretch the other end of the capacitor as
        close to GND as you can. It won't go all the way. We will bridge the gap later with wire. It should look
        something like the below picture when you are done with this step.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step7a.jpg" /></p>
      <p>Solder one end of your resistor to VCC. Solder the other to the closest pin of the potentiometer. It helps to
        wrap the resistor lead around the potentiometer pin before you solder it.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step7b.jpg" /></p>
      <p>Flip your badge over. It should look something like this.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step7c.jpg" /></p>
      <p>Gently bend the excess lead from the capacitor to pin 2 of the 2N3904. You can cut off any lead that goes
        beyond where it meets with pin 2 of the 2N3904. Solder those two connections together and trim off any excess
        leads. Once that is done it should look like the below.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step7d.jpg" /></p>
      <h3>Step 8</h3>
      <p>Grab some wire. You are going to run a wire from pin 2 of the 2N3904 to the pin of the potentiometer where you
        previously soldered the resistor. Strip a bit of sheathing off one of the ends of the wire and feed it through a
        hole close to pin 2 of the 2N3904.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step8a.jpg" /></p>
      <p>Flip the board over and solder the wire to pin 2 of the 2N3904.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step8b.jpg" /></p>
      <p>Flip the board back over, strip the other end of the wire, wrap it around the potentiometer pin a bit, then
        solder it.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step8c.jpg" /></p>
      <h3>Step 9</h3>
      <p>Grab some more wire and strip an end. Feed the stripped end through a hole next to the capacitor. Make sure you
        feed enough through to connect with the capacitor pin. Solder the wire end to the capacitor pin. The other end
        of this wire is going to a pin labled GND. Trim to length, strip the other end, and solder to GND. See below
        pictures for where this wire connects.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step9a.jpg" /></p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step9b.jpg" /></p>
      <h3>Step 10</h3>
      <p>Use a small piece of wire or component lead scrap to solder the other 2 potentiometer pins together.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step10a.jpg" /></p>
      <h3>Step 11</h3>
      <p>Use a longer piece of wire to connect the hole labled "S" to the lowest pin of the potentiometer. See below
        picture for reference. In the picture, the wire is hidden because it was tucked under the potentiometer.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step11a.jpg" /></p>
      <h3>Step 12</h3>
      <p>Use a longer piece of wire to connect pin 1 of the 2N3904 to the solder pad between J-TR and the headphone
        jack. Be sure to feed enough wire through to reach pin 1 of the 2N3904 and solder them together.
        To solder one of the wire ends to the solder pad, first heat the pad with the soldering iron while putting a
        blob of solder on it. Then grab the wire with some tweezers, melt the solder blob again, and push the wire end
        into the molten blob of solder.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step12a.jpg" /></p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step12b.jpg" /></p>
      <h3>Step 13</h3>
      <p>Last one! You're almost done. Grab another long piece of wire and connect the solder pad next to the J-S solder
        jumper and GND.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step13a.jpg" /></p>
      <h3>Step 14</h3>
      <p>Flip the board over and trim off any excess leads.</p>
      <p><img class="img-fluid" src="activity_level3_img/level3_step14a.jpg" /></p>
      <h3>Done!</h3>
      <p>Slide the knob onto your new volume control. You now have a louder badge and can adjust the volume with the
        knob you added.</p>
